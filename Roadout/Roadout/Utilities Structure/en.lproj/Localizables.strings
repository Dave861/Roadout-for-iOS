"The Roadout Team is incredibly sorry for this unfortunate situation, this shouldn’t have happened normally. Please start by making sure it is indeed your spot, check within your chosen Maps app that you are in the correct section, then look around to see if there are any other Roadout Barriers up there and check if those aren’t actually your spot. Finally, if you are sure that it is indeed your spot that is being occupied please take photos of the spot and email us at EMAIL with the subject ‘Someone occupied my spot’, attach the before mentioned images along with your name, user name, email, spot you reserved (Park Location - Section - Spot Number) and approximate date at which you made the reservation. We are really sorry for the inconvenient experience today and hope it won’t stop you from using our product again another time, if it is concluded your spot was really occupied, we will fully refund you within 72 business hours." = "The Roadout Team is incredibly sorry for this unfortunate situation, this shouldn’t have happened normally.

You have reserved SPOT-ID, below is an image with the sections in this parking location, cross check with your chosen Maps app that you are in the correct section, then look around for any Roadout barriers, chances are, if you see a locked barrier, it is yours. Alternatively, if your phone supports it, you can Open in AR and see in the real world an overlay pointing you to the spot. There is also on every Roadout Barrier marked its respective spot number, you can use that to identify your spot if you aren’t in a time crunch. We are constantly working to improve our service, if you have any feedback for us please reach at EMAIL." = "First of all, don’t worry, we will guide you through the process of locating a spot and at the end you will, in 99% of situations, have found your spot.
